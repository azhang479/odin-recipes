    <h2>What is Lasagna?</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian comfort dish made by layering wide sheets of pasta with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melty mozzarella, all baked to bubbling perfection. The heart of the dish is a savory ragù made from ground beef or pork simmered with garlic, onions, tomatoes, and Italian herbs, which is spread between layers of pasta and cheese. Each layer builds flavor and texture, resulting in a hearty, satisfying meal. Once assembled, the lasagna is baked until golden and slightly crisp on top, then rested to set before slicing. Perfect for feeding a crowd, it's a warm, flavorful dish that only gets better the next day!
