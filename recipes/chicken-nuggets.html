        <h3>What are Chicken Nuggets?</h3>
        <p>
            Chicken nuggets are bite-sized pieces of chicken that are breaded and fried until crispy and golden brown. A favorite among kids and adults alike, they can be made with either whole chicken breast pieces or ground chicken. Homemade nuggets are easy to make and often healthier than fast food versions. They're delicious when served hot with dipping sauces like ketchup, honey mustard, or barbecue sauce.
