    <h2>What is Gyudon?</h2>
    <p>
        Gyudon, or "beef bowl," is a popular Japanese dish featuring thinly sliced beef and onions simmered in a savory-sweet sauce made with soy sauce, mirin, sake, and dashi, then served over a steaming bowl of rice. It's a quick and comforting meal that combines the umami richness of the broth with the natural sweetness of onions and the tender texture of beef. Often topped with a raw or poached egg and pickled ginger, gyudon is a staple of Japanese home cooking and fast-food chains alike.
